Step 1.1

In your README.md for this assignment, answer the following question (show your work):

How many 100bp reads are needed to sequence a 1Mbp genome to 3x coverage?

1,000,000(3)/100=30,000 fragments needed to cover the genome. 



For 10: python3 week11.py
Fraction of genome with 0x coverage: 0.000111

For 3 python3 week11.py
Fraction of genome with 0x coverage: 0.051807

For 30 python3 week11.py
Fraction of genome with 0x coverage: 1e-06



command: 
dot -Tpng edges.txt -o ex2_digraph.png


In a few sentences, what would it take to accurately reconstruct the sequence of the genome?
- sufficient coverage 
- choosing the correct k mer length
